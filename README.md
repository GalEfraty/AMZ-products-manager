## Hi :)

this is my home assignment i managed to do in few hours without a css library, here are few optional future improvements:

- better mobile responsivenes (now its just scrolling on y).
- better styling, maybe a different color palette.
- full sorting to both directions: asc desc.
- pagination/virtualization.

## install:

- run `npm install`
- run `npm install -g json-server`

## Run (in different terminals)

- split terminal
- run `npm run dev`
- run `json-server --watch db.json`
